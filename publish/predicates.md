# Predicate
- a statement that contains variables that is either true or false depending on th evalue of these cariables
- P(X)=$X^2$ is greater than $X$
	- if x is 1, it is false
	- if
- once a predicate is instantiated (x is given a value) it becomes a [proposition](Proposition%20and%20Paradox#Proposition)

# The domain of a predicate
- e.g. the domain of x in P(x): integers
- different variables cna have different domains
