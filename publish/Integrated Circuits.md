# Digital Circuits
 - ICs made of collection of resistors, diodes and transistors
 - made on silicon called substrate, also called die or chip

# Discrete Components

	2. has 3 metal pins
	3. acts as a switch to close or open a cricuit
4. E.g. circuit

# Different voltages representing bits
CMOS (Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor)
- 0-1.5v = 0
- 3.5-5.0v = 1
TTL (Transistor-transistor Logic)
- 0-0.8v = 0
- 2.0-5.0v = 1

# Complexity of circuit
measured by numer of ggates in circuit
small scale < 12 gates
Medium scale 12 - 99
Large scale 100 - 9999
Very Large Scale 10000 - 99999
Ultra Large Scale 100000 - 999999
Giga scale > 1000000

small scale: logic gates weve been using
GSI: microprocessor
