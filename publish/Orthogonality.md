# Orthogonality
- if the angle between two vectors is 90 deg , then u . v = 0
- basically perpendicular 
- a set of vectors is orthogonal set if all the vectors in the set are orthogonal

# Lines and planes determined by points and normals 
- a plane in $r^3$ is determined by its inclination and one of its points
- inclination/slope is specified by the normal (perpendicular line) to the line or plane 
- for a line, point normal eqn is n * p0p = 0
- or a(x-x0) + b(y-y0) = 0![[Pasted image 20240816142710.png]]
- for a plane ![[Pasted image 20240816142728.png]]
- for a plane it would be $a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0)=0$
