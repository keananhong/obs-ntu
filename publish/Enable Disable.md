# Stweps in designing logic circuit
1. draw truth table
2. get sop / pos
3. simplify with k-map or algebraic method
4. implement circuit

# Enable / disable circuit
## Enable
- a logic circuit is enabled if the ouput is allowed to change in response to changes in inputs

## Disabled
- a logic circuit is disabled if the output is not allowed to change in response to changes in the inputs
- output either 1 or 0
