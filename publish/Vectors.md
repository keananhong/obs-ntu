# Vectors in n-D
Scalar - magnitude
Vector - magnitude and direction
Has 2 points
- initial point
- terminal point
length of arrow = magnitude
direction of arrow = direction
equal vectors have the same length and direction
zero vectors have the same initial and terminal point
- denoted by 0 with arrow on top

# Vector Addition
- Parallelogram rule
	- if v and w are vectors whos initial points coincide, they form adjacent sides of a parallelogram
	- v+w is the vector from their initial point to the opposite corner of the parallelogram

- Triangle rule
	- if initial point of v is at terminal point of w, then v+w is the vector from initial of v to terminal of w

# Vector subtraction
- the negative of a vector -v is the same length but of opposite diretion

# Multiplication
- vectors can be multiplied by scalars
- length will be v * k
- if k is negative, the direction will be opposite
