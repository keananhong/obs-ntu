# Memory
- Stores data and instructions for the CPU
- each memory location stores a byte of data and has a specific memory address
- if the data is more than a byte, it will use consecutive locations
- to access the big blob of data, use the lowest memory address of that data
- Size
	- total number of locations that a memory module can support
		- like the number of memory addresses
	- dependent on the number of bits used in its address bus
