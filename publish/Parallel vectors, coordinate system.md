# Parallel and collinear vectors
- they are the same!
- because you can move them, and moving (translating) them does not change them

# Vectors with initial points not at the origin

- v = p1p2 = op2-op1=(x2,y2)-(x1y1)=(x2-x1,y2-y1)
	- because of triangle law thingy, op1 + v = op2
	- so v = op2-op1
- works for any D
