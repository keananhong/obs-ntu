# Parametric Equation
- vector form of line that contains point $x_0$ and is parallel to vector v
	- $x-x_0 = tv$
	- or
	- $x=x_0+tv$
	- if $x_0 =0$ then line passes through the origin
	- t is called a parameter
		- x traces out the line L as t varies from negative to positive infinity
	- applies to all dimensions![[Pasted image 20240816143458.png]]
- Vector form of equation of a plane with point $x_0$ and parallel to noncollinear vectors v1 and v2
	- $x=x_0 + t_1v_1 + t_2v_2$
	- parametric equations are formed when vectors are expressed in terms of their component (component form)
