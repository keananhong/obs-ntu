# Definition
- For a set $\Bbb {S}$ is closed under $\Delta$
	- if result of operation $\Delta$ on 2 elements of $\Bbb S$ results in an element of $\Bbb S$
	- known as closure property
	- ![[Pasted image 20240815131259.png]]
	- $S_1=\{2,3,5\}, S_2=\{0,3\}$
	- delta = addition mod 6, is s1 closed?
		- no cos 2+2mod6 is 4
	- is s2 closed?
		- yes
