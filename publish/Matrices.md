# key points
- square matrix = m = n(same nnumber of rows as columns)
- Trace: sum of elements in leading diagonal
- Unit or identity matrix
	- diagonal matrix with 1s, rest is 0
- Transpose matrix
	- mxn becomes nxm
- Symmetric matrix
	- Transposed matrix is the same as the normal matrix
	- diagonal elements do not change
	- other elements are same along the diagonal i assume
- equality
- additiona and subtraction
- multiply by scalar
- properties
	- A+B = B+A
	- s(A+B) = sA + sB
	- $(A+B)^T=A^T+B^T$
- Column representation
	- each column of  a matrix can be represented as a vector
	- each element in a row of vectors represents a column of matrix
- Row representation
	- each row can be repreesnted as a vector
	- each element in a column of vectors represents a row of matrix
- Block matrices
	- a matrix of matrices is called a block matrix
	- sub-matrices
	- ![[Pasted image 20240819165247.png]]
- a 1by x matrix can also be called a vector
	- 1x3 i s a row vector
	- 2x1 is a column vector

# Matrix multiplication
- the middle 2 numbers must be the same
	- 1x3 * 3X1 will give you 1x1
	- ![[1_YGcMQSr0ge_DGn96WnEkZw.png]]
- Other lawsa
- matrix x Identity matrix = matrix
- $(AB)^T=B^TA^T$
	- b and a are reversed mf
- $(A+B)^T=A^T+B^T$
	- plussing is bussing
- You can partially calculate matrix mult if youre only interested in a certain row
	- ![[Pasted image 20240819170819.png]]just pull out the row / column you neee
- Matrix product as linear combinations
	- an mxn matrix times a nx1 will equate a combination of column vectors where the coefficients are elements of x
	- ![[Pasted image 20240819171809.png]]
- Inverse matrix
	- AB = BA = I
	- if there is no B for the A, then the matrix is singular and has no inverse
	- ![[Pasted image 20240819171923.png]]
	- to find inverse:
		- 1/ad-bc * swapped a and d, -b -c elements
		- ad-bc is called the determinant
	- If A and B are invertible and of the same size,
		- $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$
	- If A is invertible, $A^T$ is invertible, and $(A^T)^{-1}=(A^{-1})^T$
	- whatever the f this is ![[Pasted image 20240819172507.png]]
