# Things to note
- everything labeled
	- pin numbers
	- IC numbers
	- comp values
	- value signal names
	- power supply voltages
- active high/low labeled
- bubble to bubble

Bubble to bubble example

switch the nand to the alternate form

# Debugging
- Fault detection
- fault isolation
- fault correction
- Internal IC faults
	- malfuncitons
	- short circuit
	- open circuit
	- short between two pins
- External IC faults
	- open signla line
	- shorted signal lines
	- faulty power supply
	- wrong connection
	- NEVER 
		- output to output unless you are very sure
		- output to Vcc, Gnd, other fixed voltage level
