### Digital logic irl is usually represented in circuits voltage
- 0-0.8v is low
- 2-5v is high
- anything in between is indeterminate
- For a truth table, the number of rows is $2^n$ where n is the number of inputs
	- number of columns is the $i + o$ where i is number of input and o is number of output
