# Inverse
Theorems
- If A is an inveritble nxn matrix, then Ax=b has teh solution x = $A^{-1}b$
- If A is invertiuble, then A^-1 is invertible and $(A^{-1})^{-1}$ = A
- If A and B are nxn invertible, then AB is invertible and $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$
- If A is invertible, then $A^T$ is also invertible and $(A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T$

# Elementary Matrix
