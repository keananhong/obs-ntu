# Natural Numbers
- 1,2,3
- if 0 is included, its called whole numbers

# Intergers
- Natural numbers + negative numbers

# Real numbers
- any value on the number line
- pi
- 0.696969969696969699696
- 2 types
	- Rational numbers
		- can be represented in a/b where a and b are integers
		- 999/1000 is represented in 2 numbers, so its rational
	- Irrational Numbers
		- cannot be represented in a/b
		- like pi, $e$, $\sqrt2$

# Prove that $\sqrt{6}$ is irrational
suppose $\sqrt{6}=p/q$ for some integer p,q with greatest common denominator 1
$6q^2=p^2$
$p^2$ must be even (because $6q^2 = 3*2(q)^2$ = $p^2$ and q,p must be integers) and p must be even (because only even * even is always even)
$p=2s$ for some integer s
plugging $p=2s$ to ** gives $3q^2=(2s)^2$
so $3q^2$ must be even, and $q^2$ must be even and thus q is evem
This contradicts assumptions that gcd = 1
thus $\sqrt6$ is irrational
