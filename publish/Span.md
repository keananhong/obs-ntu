# Definition of a Span
If $V_1,V_2,\dots$ are in Rn, then the set of all possible linear combintaions is denoted by Span {v1,v2,v3}. It is a combination of all vectors that can be written in linear combination form, and its called the subset of Rn spanned by v1v2v3

- Askiong whether B is in teh span {a1,a2} is the same as asking is there a solution for x1a1 + x2xa2 = b 
- solve using [row echelon form](Linear%20combination%20of%20vectors#Question!)
