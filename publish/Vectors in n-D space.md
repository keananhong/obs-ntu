# Vectors in n-D space
- each dimension has its own coord
- point in 5d space = (w,x,y,z,a)

## k and m are scalars

# Linear Combination
- if w is a vector,
	- it is a linear combination of v1,v2,v3,v4,v5
	- expressed in the form w=k1v1 + k2v2 + knvn
	- k1k2k3 are scalars called coefficients of the linear combination
