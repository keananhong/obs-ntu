# choices and slots
- in general, n1, n2, n3, nk choices for k slots
- n1*n2*n3*nk
- for a 3 digit combi lock, 0-9
	- 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000 possible combis

# cardinality of power set
- for set A = {a1, a2, an}
- list all subsets of A, create table![[Pasted image 20240911160615.png]]
- each element in A is either a subset A or not: 2 choices
- choice needs to be made for each element
- 2^n choices

# FIll r slots with n choices
- there are n elements to fill r slots
- repeating
	- n^r choices
- non-repeating
	- n(n-1)(n-2)(n-r+1) slots
	-
